   When used after a `kinvey-cli` command, shows its usage instructions.

* `--instance-id <instance ID>`

   ID (e.g., `kvy-us2`) or full hostname (e.g., `https://kvy-us2-manage.kinvey.com/`) of a Kinvey instance. It has a default value of `kvy-us1` (or `https://manage.kinvey.com/`) which most customers should use. If you are a customer on a dedicated Kinvey instance, enter your dedicated instance ID.

* `--no-color`

    Disable colors.
    
* `--output <format>`
   
   Output format. Valid choices: json.

* `--password <password>`

   Password for your Kinvey account.

## Environment Variables

Use environment variables to specify profile information for the `profile create` command when you don't want to specify it at the command line. Keep in mind that any values specified at the command line take precedence over the environment variable values.

Command-specific options can also be specified as environment variables. You just need to prefix the name of the option with `KINVEY_CLI_`. For example, `--no-prompt` becomes `KINVEY_CLI_NO_PROMPT` as environment variable.

* `KINVEY_CLI_EMAIL`

   Email address of your Kinvey account.

* `KINVEY_CLI_PASSWORD`

   Password for your Kinvey account.

   ID (e.g., `kvy-us2`) or full hostname (e.g., `https://kvy-us2-manage.kinvey.com/`) of a Kinvey instance. It has a default value of `kvy-us1` (or `https://manage.kinvey.com/`) which most customers should use. If you are a customer on a dedicated Kinvey instance, enter your dedicated instance ID.

* `KINVEY_CLI_2FA`

    Two-factor authentication token.

* `KINVEY_CLI_PROFILE`

   Profile to use.
   
Kinvey CLI also supports these universal environment variables:

* `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`

   Routes all Kinvey CLI requests through the specified proxy server.


## Getting Help

Kinvey CLI comes with a two-stage help system. You can either call the `help` command to see an overview of the available commands or request details about a command usage with the `-h` flag.

    kinvey help

    kinvey flex -h

    kinvey flex logs -h


## Getting Started

Kinvey CLI requires you to authenticate. The fastest way to get started is to run the `kinvey init` command. It prompts for credentials and hostname and creates a working profile for you, which stores the provided settings for future executions.

Note that you only need to specify an instance ID if you are on a dedicated Kinvey instance. Otherwise just press Enter to continue.

When prompted for `Profile name`, enter a name for your new working profile that Kinvey CLI will create for you. Kinvey CLI will use this profile automatically for future executions as long as it is the only profile on the system. You can create new profiles and select an active profile if you need to.

```
$ kinvey init
? E-mail john.doe@kinvey.com
? Password ***********
? Instance ID (optional) kvy-us1
? Profile name dev
```

You can run `kinvey init` from any directory as it always writes your new profile in your home directory.

Next, you need to configure Kinvey CLI to connect to a Flex Service that you've already created using the Kinvey Console or through `kinvey flex create <service-name>`.

For the following commands, you need to switch to the Node.js project directory that you will be deploying as a Flex Service as the configuration they create and read is project-specific.

```
cd <node.js project dir>
kinvey flex init
```

Through a series of prompts, this command will ask you for a domain in which to operate (app or organization) and a Flex Service to deploy to.

Finally, you are ready to deploy your Node.js project as a Flex Service.

    kinvey flex deploy
    
Alongside the deploy you can set environment variables for your service. If both names and values are void of the equality sign (`=`) and comma (`,`), you can use the shorthand syntax:

    kinvey flex deploy --set-vars "MY_APP_A=valueA,MY_APP_B=valueB" 
    
Otherwise you need to specify environment variables in stringified JSON format:

    kinvey flex deploy --set-vars "{\"MY_APP_A\":[\"value 1\", \"value 2\"], \"MY_APP_B\":\"valueB\"}"

**Note**: Kinvey CLI sends binary data (content type "multipart/form-data") during the deploy process. The deploy job will fail if traffic of this type is blocked within your network.

## Managing Profiles

Another way to create working profiles, besides running `kinvey init`, is invoking `kinvey profile create <name>`. You can choose between providing the credentials at the command line or as preset [environment variables](#environment-variables).

    kinvey profile create dev --email john.doe@kinvey.com --password john'sPassword --instanceId kvy-us2

You can create multiple profiles and specify which one to use at the command line.

    kinvey flex init --profile dev

If you don't want to specify a profile every time, you can set one as active and it will be used for future executions:

    kinvey profile use dev


**Note**: If you have a single profile, you can skip setting it as active as well as providing it as a command line option. It will be used if no other credentials are provided.

### Authentication Token Expiration

As part of creating a working profile, the authentication token provided by Kinvey is stored locally. This token will be used to authenticate future command executions until it expires. At that point, you need to reenter your password or recreate the profile to keep working with Kinvey CLI. Run `kinvey profile login` to reenter your password. You can recreate the profile by providing the profile name to `kinvey init` or `kinvey profile create`.

## Authenticating One-time Commands

Every command that requires authentication can take credentials and a hostname as command line options. If a hostname is not provided, its default value is used.

    kinvey flex status --service <service-id> --email <email> --password <password>

You can also provide the same information through environment variables before running the command.

**Linux, macOS**
```
export KINVEY_CLI_EMAIL=<email>
export KINVEY_CLI_PASSWORD=<password>
export KINVEY_CLI_INSTANCE_ID=<instance ID>
```

**Windows**
```
set KINVEY_CLI_EMAIL=<email>
set KINVEY_CLI_PASSWORD=<password>
set KINVEY_CLI_INSTANCE_ID=<instance ID>
```

## Precedence of Configuration Options

For the Kinvey CLI commands that require passing configuration values, the following precedence order applies.

* Command line options&mdash;take precedence when specified
* Environment variables&mdash;the first choice when command line arguments are missing
* Profile data&mdash;values saved as part of the applicable working profile are used if neither command line arguments nor environment variables are set


## Output Format

Kinvey CLI supports two output formats: plain text and JSON. Both are printed on the screen unless you redirect the output using shell syntax.

Plain text is printed by default. Depending on the command, it produces tabular data or a simple message stating that the action has completed successfully.

The JSON output format is suitable for cases where the output must be handled programmatically. It could be further processed using a tool like jq (command-line JSON processor). You can run any command with `--output json`. The output will then have the following format:

```
{
    "result": [result]
}
```

## Flex Runtime Version Selection

Flex projects that you deploy run server-side on the Flex Runtime which represents a preconfigured Node.js environment. When creating a project and later when running it, you can select a Node.js version for the project to run on using the `--runtime` option. To see the available runtime versions, run `kinvey flex deploy --help`.

The runtime selection is limited to the major Node.js version. The minor and patch versions are always determined by the Flex Runtime.

New Flex services deploy on the [Kinvey-recommended Node.js version](https://devcenter.kinvey.com/guides/flexservice-runtime#environment) unless otherwise specified.

After you deploy a Flex project, it remains on the same Node.js version until you upgrade it to a new major version or Kinvey decides to upgrade the project's runtime to a more recent minor and patch version because of security or efficiency reasons.

## Proxy Settings

Kinvey CLI supports the universal environment variables `HTTPS_PROXY` and `https_proxy` for routing commands through a proxy server. Set it if you are using a proxy.


    export HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.local


## Configuration management

Kinvey CLI supports the usage of configuration files (JSON format) to enable configuring certain aspects of the backend.

**Organizations** can be modified by applying an organization configuration file. The file can contain applications and org-level services.

**Applications** can be created and modified by applying an application configuration file. The file can contain app environments and app-level services.

**Environments** can be created and modified by applying an environment configuration file. The file can contain: environment-related settings, collections, business logic, roles, push settings.

**Services** can be created and modified by applying a service configuration file. Supported services: internal flex, external flex, REST, Sharepoint, Salesforce, MS SQL, ProgressData, DataDirect, Rapid health.

### Environment configuration file

The environment configuration file can be used to create a brand new environment or to modify an existing one. It is easiest to generate the file by 'exporting' an existent environment and making the necessary modifications. To export an environment run:
 
 ```
kinvey appenv export (--file <file-path>) [--env <env>] [--app <app>]
```

Alternatively, the environment template beneath can be used and modified as needed.

To create an environment from a configuration file run:
 ```
kinvey appenv create <envName> (--file <file-path>) (--app <AppNameOrID>)
```

To apply a configuration file to an existent environment run:
 ```
kinvey appenv apply [--file <file-path>] (-env <env>) (--app <app>)
```

Before an environment config file gets applied a check will be executed to verify JSON is valid and parameter values are allowed. If the check passes successfully, Kinvey CLI will start applying the changes. In the case of a new environment it will simply try to create all the entities described in the file. 

When the file is being applied to an existent environment then existent entities could be updated and new ones can be created. The CLI won't delete any entities even if they are not included in the file. Hence, if you want to create new endpoints but don't want to modify any existent collections for example, then you can exclude them from the configuration to have the file being applied faster.

If an error occurs, the CLI stops applying the file and outputs the error message.

### Service configuration file

The service configuration file can be used to create a brand new service or to modify an existing one (excluding Auth services).

To create a service from a configuration file run:
 ```
kinvey service create <serviceName> <file-path> [--app AppNameOrId|--org OrgNameOrId]
```

Either `--app` or `--org` option must be set. The service will be accessible only to the chosen application or organization respectively.

To apply a configuration file to an existent service run:
 ```
kinvey service apply [--file <file-path>] [--service <service-ID>]
``` 

When a new internal flex service is created the CLI will attempt a deploy if `sourcePath` is set to the project root directory. 

When an existent internal flex service is updated and `sourcePath` is set, the CLI will attempt to deploy only if the version defined in `package.json` is higher then the cloud version. Otherwise, deployment procedure will be skipped.

The following service templates can be used and modified as needed:

### Caveats

Kinvey CLI is a subject to the following caveats:

- The CLI has a 10-second request timeout when communicating with the backend for initialization which may cause a connection error in some rare cases. Retrying the command remedies the problem in many cases.
- If you are using a profile that has been configured a while ago, you may stumble upon the `InvalidCredentials` error. It may mean that the session token has expired. See [Authentication Token Expiration](#authentication-token-expiration) for details.
- You cannot deploy the same service version to the FlexService Runtime more than once. You must increment the version in `package.json` before redeploying.
- Kinvey CLI sends binary data (content type "multipart/form-data") during the deploy process. The deploy job will fail if traffic of this type is blocked within your network.
- There is a limit of 100 MB to the size of the FlexService logs that are kept on the backend. When log entries exceed that size, the oldest ones are deleted.
- Running the CLI from Git Bash on Windows is known to cause issues ranging from failing commands to complete inability to start. Use Windows Command Prompt instead.

### Support for Service Environments

Kinvey CLI version 4.1.0 introduces support for environments inside Flex services coinciding with the release of this feature on the backend. When upgrading from a previous Kinvey CLI version, have the following caveats in mind:

- The `flex init` interactive command prompts for service environment selection in version 4.1.0 and later if the service contains multiple environments.
- Node.js projects configured with `flex init` with a Kinvey CLI version predating 4.1.0 do not contain a service environment ID. Therefore:
    - We recommend rerunning the `flex init` command on these projects.
    - Flex commands targeting the current service will continue to work as long as the service has a single environment.
    - Flex commands targeting the current service will error out if you create additional environments inside the service and don't include `--env`.
- Flex commands specifying a particular service using `--service` must include `--env` if the service has multiple environments. You can omit `--env` if the service has a single environment.
